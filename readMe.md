# eCommerce-Server-Express

An eCommerce database built on Express.js and Node.js.

## Installation and Setup

- install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
- `git clone` and `cd` to eCommerce-Server-Express
- `npm install`
- log into mySQL account and run `source db/schema.sql` to create "ecommerce_db" database.
- rename the `.envEXAMPLE` file to `.env` and edit with your mySQL username and password

```
    DB_NAME="ecommerce_db"
    DB_USER="Your User Name"
    DB_PW="Your Password"
```

- `npm run seeds` to create the schema for your `ecommerce_db` database and seed data to it 

## Features

- Database includes `categories` (e.g., sweaters), `products` (e.g., JCrew - Merino Wool), and `tags` (e.g., European, brown, winter)
- Many to Many relationships between products and tags
- GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categoies, prodcts, and tags
- Modularized codebase for scalability

## Usage

2. From the app directory, `node server.js` to start the server on your computer on port 3001
3. In Postman or Insomnia, enter the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` route you wish to test and the requisite JSON data (for POST and PUT routes); e.g.,
